I am a rising third-year PhD student at Princeton University in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. I did my undergraduate work in physics and chemical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Here, my research focused on quantifying the activity and stability of catalytic materials using quantum mechanical modeling methods, microkinetic models, and classical thermodynamics. My broad interests are in modeling molecular physics, scientific computing, and machine learning. My recent work has focused on representation learning strategies for polymeric materials and designing such materials with Bayesian optimization. 

**I am interested in tackling the following problems:**

1. Can we design physics-inspired models and optimization algorithms to efficiently search high-dimensional physiochemical design spaces?
2. How can we better interpret machine learning models to gain physical insights? 

**Projects I'm actively pursuing include:**

1. Dimensionality reduction of design spaces with deep, Bayesian latent variable models that obey physical constraints
2. Uncertainty quantification in deep representation learning algorithms for topological polymers
3. Controlled assembly of soft materials with reinforcement learning
4. Defining extrapolability and interpolability in sequence and topology defined data
5. Understanding equilibrium self-assembly with deep, Bayesian latent variable models
